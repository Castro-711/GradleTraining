/*
Notes:
1. can run different file instead of build.gradle using -b
2. run 'gradle tasks --all' to see custom tasks
    * all wrapper files should be committed to the repo
    * the wrapper ensures all users are running same version of gradle
3. you can use camelCase and supply the minimal name for the task
    * gradleVersion -> gV
    * it has to be unique or else fail with an ambiguous error
4. use 'Jps' to see running java processes
    * will show running daemons
